# Domain-Name-Generator
Domain Name Generator project from 4Geeks


Finding a domain name is hard, so why not automate it? :)

### Then follow these steps:

1. Create one `app.js` javascript file.
2. Add your code inside your app.js file.
3. You have to use `console.log("Any string");` to show something on the console.
4. Run your code by typing: `$ node app.js`, **if you run it locally, make sure you have node.js**

## üìù Instructions

Create a script that generate all the possible domain name combinations from a list of pronouns, adjectives and nouns, for example:

```js
  let pronoun = ['the','our'];
  let adj = ['great', 'big' ];
  let noun = ['jogger','racoon'];
```

Should generate something like:

```bash
thegreatjogger.com
thegreatracoon.com
ourgreatjogger.com
ourgreatracoon.com
thebigjogger.com
thebigracoon.com
ourbigjogger.com
ourbigracoon.com
```

### üí° Hint

You'll need to use nested for loops in order to mix the different values together.

Your tools: For loop, string concatenation.

## üòé Feeling confident?

- Add several types of extensions: .com, .net, .us, .io, etc.

- Add domain hacks, for example: instead of `lastOfUs.com` you can use the `.us` domain like this: `lastOf.us`

## A bit of history about the project

Before the domain market was centralized and converted into a mafia 
controlled by Godaddy, Enom, and others. Normal people like you and me 
are able to buy a .com domain relatively easily. 

In fact, this project was originally built in 2002 by one of the 4Geeks teachers 
while he was trying to find domain names to buy for several projects.

This and many other projects are built by students as part of the 4Geeks Academy [Coding Bootcamp](https://4geeksacademy.com/us/coding-bootcamp) by [Alejandro Sanchez](https://twitter.com/alesanchezr) and many other contributors.
